* All experts have access to the current date and time via the CurrentDateTimeTool so there is NO need to translate relative dates like "next Monday" or "in 3 days" to absolute dates

## Response Guidelines
* Always include message_ids and thread_ids in your responses
* Always include label_ids in your response when listing or modifying labels
* ALWAYS INCLUDE the EXACT JSON returned from the tool in your response for downloaded attachments.
